Hi [...Name...],

We love that your organization supports [...something...]. We are looking for locations to hold our monthly hackathon meetup and think the synergies between [...company...] and CivicTechWR would make for an ideal partnership. We currently have [...list of dates...] open. The commitment on your side is time and space -- that's it! Would you be interested in hosting the group on one of these dates?

## What's CivicTechWR?

CivicTechWR is an inclusive multi-disciplinary group that aims to connect citizens, civic innovators, technologists, community groups, governments, and entrepreneurs with civic tech initiatives. We strive to empower people to work together, exchange ideas and tools to improve the lives of the residents in and around Waterloo Region through civic technology.

## What's Civic Technology?

There are lots of definitions, but at the end of the day, it's about using technology for the public good.

## What's a CivicTechWR Meetup?

Once a month, we host a leader from the community to speak to the group. This could be someone from a local non-profit, from government, from industry, or any citizen - what matters is that they have something to share with our group, something to teach us, or something to inspire us.

During our events, we also provide space and time for people to come and work together on civic tech projects. This is where you and [...company...] could help us out. Ideally, any space we use has great WiFi, power, and whiteboards. These meetings are held after core working hours until roughly 8:00pm and could attract up to [...Number...] of people. Do you have a space and the time to connect with some of the brightest minds in the local community?

Let us know if you have any questions!
