### Minutes

### Action Items

## 22 June 2017
- First-impressions matter, so we need an onboarding process for new members
- We need to reach out to civic tech related organizations in our area and want to ensure that the message about who we are is consistent. We also need to have a process for new partners to ensure we include them in the right way and leverage them.
- We also want to know what tools and projects are available - like Civic Toronto's Budgetpedia - so we can consider adapting their project to our area.
- Also, many other organizations like Civic Accelerator Labs and Ontario Digital Government are trying to do what we want to do. So we should find out what tools they have already used to solve their challenges, versus us starting from scratch on everything.
- We discussed that our first project should not be an ongoing project that requires administration. Our first project should be shorter in duration with an end date.
- We discussed that we are the glue of our area and desire to be a resource to these other Civic Tech organizations
- We talked about databases like how we will store contact information. We also discussed emails briefly, mentioned MailChimp.
- We believe we can get space at Communitech or at the Tannery
### Action Items
- Doug Akers: research other similar orgs for some words around our org's purpose & goals
- Everyone: dig up some existing open source candidate projects in the civic tech space that could overlap with open data feeds from our region, and see what it might take to localize - should give a quick win that we could point to as an initial success to start drumming up interest.
