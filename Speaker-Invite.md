# What's CivicTechWR?
CivicTechWR is an inclusive multi-disciplinary group that aims to connect citizens, civic innovators, technologists, community groups, governments, and entrepreneurs with civic tech initiatives. We strive to empower people to work together, exchange ideas and tools to improve the lives of the residents in and around Waterloo Region through civic technology.

# What's Civic Technology?
There are lots of definitions, but at the end of the day, it's about using technology for the public good.

# What's a CivicTechWR Meetup?
Once a month, we host a leader from the community to speak to the group. This could be someone from a local non-profit, from government, from industry, or any citizen - what matters is that they have something to share with our group, something to teach us, or something to inspire us.

During our events, we also provide space and time for people to come and work together on civic tech projects. Ideally, any space we use has great WiFi, power, and whiteboards.

Let us know if you have any questions!
